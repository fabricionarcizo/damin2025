## Additional Resources

### Python Scripts

Original Python scripts are also available for command-line execution:

- `ex02_fp_growth_algorithm.py`

### Folders

- **`data/`**: Retail transaction dataset used in the notebooks (DVC managed)

### Files

- **`data.dvc`**: Data Version Control file for dataset management

## Dataset Information

The notebooks use the **Online Retail Dataset**, which contains:

- Transactional data from an online retail store
- Multiple attributes including InvoiceNo, Description, Quantity, Country
- Real-world shopping cart information
- Focus on transactions from specific countries (e.g., Portugal)

## Learning Path

**Recommended sequence for maximum learning effectiveness:**

1. **Apriori Foundation** (Ex 1): Start with the classic algorithm

   - Understand frequent itemset mining fundamentals
   - Learn support, confidence, and lift metrics
   - Practice rule evaluation and filtering

2. **FP-Growth Efficiency** (Ex 2): Explore the optimized approach
   - Compare with Apriori methodology
   - Understand FP-Tree construction
   - Learn advanced visualization techniques

Each notebook builds upon fundamental concepts of association rule mining, providing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills for real-world market basket analysis.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure all required Python libraries are installed

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn mlxtend plotly openpyxl
   ```

2. **Data Access**: Ensure the Online Retail dataset is available in `data/` folder

3. **Launch Notebooks**: Open notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code

4. **Follow Sequence**: Work through notebooks in the recommended order

5. **Run Python Scripts**: Alternatively, execute `.py` files directly from terminal

   ```bash
   python lecture13/ex01_ipriori_algorithm.py
   python lecture13/ex02_fp_growth_algorithm.py
   ```

6. **Experiment**: Modify parameters (min_support, min_threshold) and test with different countries

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Frequent Itemset Mining**: Discovering sets of items that frequently appear together
- **Support**: Proportion of transactions containing an itemset
- **Confidence**: Conditional probability of consequent given antecedent
- **Lift**: Ratio of observed support to expected support (independence measure)
- **Apriori Principle**: If an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets are infrequent
- **FP-Tree**: Compact data structure for efficient pattern mining
- **Market Basket Analysis**: Discovering purchasing patterns in retail data
- **Rule Evaluation**: Filtering and ranking association rules by interestingness measures

## Practical Applications

- **Retail**: Product placement, promotional bundles, cross-selling strategies
- **E-commerce**: Recommendation systems, "customers who bought X also bought Y"
- **Inventory Management**: Stock optimization based on purchasing patterns
- **Marketing**: Targeted campaigns based on product associations
- **Healthcare**: Treatment pattern analysis, drug interaction studies
- **Web Analytics**: Page visit patterns, clickstream analysis

This comprehensive collection provides both theoretical understanding and practical skills for effective association rule mining in real-world data mining applications, from traditional Apriori to efficient FP-Growth algorithms.
